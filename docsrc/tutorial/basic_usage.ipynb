    "**Info:** For this simple small data set there is virtually no performance difference between the policies. In general, bulk computation can be computationally more efficient as we can easily make use of efficient external neighbour-search methods. It also allows us to recycle once computed neighbourhood information for cluster approaches with varying `cnn_cutoff` but same `radius_cutoff`. On the other hand it can be quite memory-intensive for large data sets to store the neighbourhood information alongside the data in the original format. Computing the neighbourhoods on-the-fly as we go through the data set is memory friendly but can be computationally more expensive as we fall back to brute-force neighbour-search and once computed information can not be re-used (although this is partly countered by caching). Instead of relying on the specific methods used with the *progressive* policy, the user is also encouraged to pre-compute input with any external method of choice as needed. The possibilities of calculating neighbourhood or distance information are vast and it is wise to choose the appropriate technique for the particular data at hand.\n",
